# ColorBilliard-Unity
George Brown Game Contest 2nd place winner solo unity 3d project

The game is designed with a resolution of 1280 x 720 in mind, but all 16:9 resolutions are fine (and forced by the launcher)

Game rules and buttons are explained under menu item, "How to Play". (Navigate the menus with mouse)


Have fun!
