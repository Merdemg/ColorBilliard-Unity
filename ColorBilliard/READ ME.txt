The game is designed with a resolution of 1280 x 720 in mind, but all 16:9 resolutions are fine (and forced by the launcher)

To play simply unzip the whole folder and run "ColorBilliard.exe".

Game rules and buttons are explained under menu item, "How to Play". (Navigate the menus with mouse)

Have fun!
